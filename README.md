Scanner package that use Machine learning models to scan over theoretical HEP models free parameters based on [arXiv:2207.09959 [hep-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09959). \
The package uses SPheno to calculate the physical observables and link the output to HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals programs. \
ML models is used to asses the scan over the Lagrangian parameters to fit the desired chi squared value reported by HiggsSignals program. 

To use the package please look at [How to run the package](https://github.com/AHamamd150/MLscanner/blob/main/How%20to%20run%20the%20package).
