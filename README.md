Scanner package that use Machine learning models to scan over theoretical HEP models free parameters based on [arXiv:2207.09959 [hep-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09959). 

The package uses SPheno to calculate the physical observables and link the output to HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals programs.

To use the package please look at 


** Animation to demonstrate how the ML can suggest points in the target region to be accumulated for demo 2&3d functions defined in the paper.
